# User Personas

## 1. Primary Persona: "Quality Quinn" (The QA Engineer)
* **Role:** Manual QA Tester at a mid-sized tech company.
* **Pain Point:** Spends 6 hours a day manually clicking "Login," "Sign Up," and "Forgot Password" to check for regressions. Hates writing Selenium scripts because they break every week.
* **Goal:** Wants a tool that "just finds the bugs" so she can focus on complex user flows and strategy.
* **Usage Pattern:** Uploads a URL on Monday morning, lets the system run, and reviews the report after lunch.

## 2. Secondary Persona: "Dev Dave" (The Developer)
* **Role:** Full-stack Developer.
* **Pain Point:** Hates getting bug reports that say "It doesn't work." Needs to know *exactly* what input caused the crash.
* **Goal:** Wants a JSON report with exact reproduction steps and a screenshot so he can fix it in 5 minutes.
* **Usage Pattern:** Checks the dashboard only when a build fails.

## 3. Tertiary Persona: "Startup Sam" (The Founder)
* **Role:** Founder of a new SaaS product.
* **Pain Point:** Can't afford a QA team yet. Is terrified of launching with a critical security bug.
* **Goal:** Needs a "sanity check" to ensure the app is secure and basic flows work before investor demos.
* **Usage Pattern:** Runs a full scan once a week before deployment.
