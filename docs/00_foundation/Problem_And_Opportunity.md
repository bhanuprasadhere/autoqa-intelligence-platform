Problem and Opportunity Analysis
1. Current Industry Problems
Manual Testing Limitations

Manual testers must repeatedly:

Open pages

Fill forms

Click buttons

Check error messages

This work is slow and difficult to scale as applications grow.

Traditional Automation Limitations

Script-based testing tools:

Break when the UI changes

Require engineers to maintain test logic

Only test what has been explicitly written

This leads to limited coverage of unknown or unexpected issues.

2. Opportunity

There is a growing need for systems that can:

Automatically explore applications

Detect risky behavior

Identify abuse patterns

Provide structured data for dashboards and analytics

Companies want:

Faster testing cycles

Better security awareness

Less maintenance effort

3. Market Gap

Most tools focus on:

Helping testers write automation faster

Very few tools focus on:

Letting the system decide what to test

This platform aims to fill that gap.

4. Business Impact

If successful, the platform can:

Reduce QA costs

Improve release quality

Lower security risks

Speed up development cycles
